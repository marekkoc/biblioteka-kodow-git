The mobile phone company PhonyPhones needs to create a system for managing their customers' phone plans and they need to get better insight into the data that they need to store. Because their CEO knows a bit of Python, he asks you to write a few dataclasses representing the data structure of their application. In short, they have customers (name, address, email address), phones (brand, model, price, serial number) and plans (which refer to a customer, a phone, a start date, the total number of months in the contract, a monthly price, and whether the phone is included in the contract).

Write dataclasses that can represent this data. You may take some freedom in how things like addresses etc. are represented.
